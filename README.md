# Introduction
Server-Sent Events (SSE) is a simple and efficient technology for sending real-time updates from the server to the browser over a single HTTP connection. In this demonstration, we'll implement a basic Express.js server with TypeScript to showcase the SSE concept. We'll create an SSE endpoint that sends real-time updates to connected clients.

## Pre-requisites
Ensure that you have Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) installed on your system. You can download and install Node.js from the official website (https://nodejs.org/).

## Installation
Navigate to the project directory.

Install dependencies `npm install`

Run the application `npm run dev`

Observe the server sent event on user client via `http://localhost:3000`
